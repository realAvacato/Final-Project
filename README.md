# Final-Project


I looked at the example project as a guide to help me build everything. I'm not sure how well everything will work not on my machine/ permissions and other things so I uploaded pictures of the database connection being connected. I couldn't figure out the data visualization in dashboard so I did it in a seperate jupityer notebook and took a screenshot.

I used mongoDB to host the employees table from a JSON. The connection string is mongodb+srv://root:gthgthgth@ds2002.20qvgzt.mongodb.net/test

The azure server I used had server name as mysql-czhong.mysql.database.azure.com and Server admin login name:dsadmin 


For the mySQL portion I used the same code from the midterm so I didn't upload it again.
